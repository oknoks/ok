  <h2>Learn More</h2>
  <p>
    The FEDn framework is designed to support the entire innovation journey from
    personal testing to proof-of-concepts to geographically distributed FL in
    the real-world. As a data scientist, bring your ML code and use FEDn to go
    from centralized to federated with no code change and minimal DevOps
    complexity.
  </p>
  <h3>FEDn core features</h3>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <hgroup>
        <h4>Scalability and resilience</h4>
        <p>
          FEDn boosts federated learning by efficiently coordinating client
          models and aggregating them across several servers, catering to high
          client volumes and ensuring robust recovery from failures. It supports
          asynchronous training, smoothly handling client connectivity changes.
        </p>
      </hgroup>
    </div>
    <div>
      <hgroup>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>
          FEDn enhances security in federated learning environments by
          eliminating the need for clients to open ingress ports and using
          standard encryption protocols and token authentication. This approach
          streamlines deployment across varied settings and ensures secure, easy
          integration.
        </p>

  <h3>Flexible deployment options</h3>
  <p>
    FEDn Studio deploys to any standard Kubernetes cluster. This ensures
    flexible hosting options ranging from public and private cloud, to
    on-premise clusters and single workstations.
  </p>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <hgroup>
        <h4>Software as a Service</h4>
        <p>
          We provide a fully managed cloud-hosted instance of FEDn. Requiering
          no server-side DevOps, this is the easiest way to get started with FL.
          By keeping all focus on the ML problem client-side, this is deal for
          early-stage projects, including pilots and proof-of-value phases.
        </p>
      </hgroup>
    </div>
    <div>
      <hgroup>
        <h4>Self-hosted</h4>
        <p>
          For organizations with stringent cybersecurity needs, FEDn can be
          deployed on private clouds / VPCs or on-premise, allowing full control
          over the deployment and enhanced security and privacy.
        </p>
      </hgroup>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Framework agnostic</h3>
  <p>
    FEDn is designed to be ML-framework agnostic, seamlessly supporting major
    frameworks such as Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Huggingface and scikit-learn.
    Ready-to-use examples are provided, facilitating immediate application
    across different ML frameworks.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Why should we choose your FL framework over other options?
    </summary>
    <p>
      Our framework offers an easy-to-use interface, visual aids, and
      collaboration tools for ML/FL projects, with features like distributed
      tracing and event logging for debugging and performance analysis. It
      ensures security through client identity management and authentication,
      and has scalable architecture with multiple servers and load-balancers.
      FEDn also allows flexible experimentation, session management, and
      deployment on any cloud or on-premises infrastructure.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Can we build our own IP using your framework?</summary>
    <p>
      Absolutely. You can develop your own IP without any conflict. Utilize our
      framework and Scaleout’s expertise to accelerate your project. There's no
      risk of lock-in, as our Software Development Kit (SDK) for integration is
      licensed under Apache2. We're confident you'll find value in our support
      services, warranty, indemnification, and comprehensive toolkit.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Is this yet another ML platform we have to install?</summary>
    <p>
      FEDn is a versatile framework that can be extended, configured, and
      integrated into existing systems to tailored to your environment. For
      effective Federated Learning (FL) management, deployment of server-side
      components and charts is necessary. It enhances rather than replaces your
      current setup.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How can I explore FL without deep technical expertise?</summary>
    <p>
      We offer a cloud-hosted FL platform for easy FL exploration, optimized for
      cost and ideal for R&amp;D. Scaleout enables data scientists to
      investigate FL without initial IT/DevOps resources. We provide a smooth
      transition to self-hosted production with enterprise integrations,
      ensuring your PoC is scalable, secure, and representative of real-world
      scenarios.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What deployment options does FEDn offer?</summary>
    <p>
      FEDn offers two main deployment options to cater to different
      organizational needs and project stages. The fully-managed SaaS (Software
      as a Service) model simplifies access to federated learning technology,
      making it ideal for early-stage projects, pilots, and proof-of-value
      phases. For organizations with strict cybersecurity requirements, FEDn can
      be deployed on private clouds or on-premise, providing full control over
      deployment, security, and privacy. This self-managed option is
      particularly suitable for advanced security needs, such as protecting
      IP-sensitive ML models.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How can FEDn support my federated learning needs?</summary>
    <p>
      FEDn supports a range of capabilities to meet diverse organizational
      demands. It offers both multi-tenant and single-tenant options, allowing
      organizations to choose the configuration that best suits their needs.
      Additionally, FEDn takes care of complex operations management, including
      server aggregation, data storage, user authentication, network
      configuration, and system monitoring. This reduces the operational burden
      on users, enabling them to focus on developing and refining their
      federated learning.
