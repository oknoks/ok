# Philosophy of the Good Life
 
![Marcus Aurelius](https://i.ibb.co/hZrMQZ0/Marcus-Aurelius-1.jpg)

It is always and everywhere in your power to resign to the gods, to be just to mankind, and to examine every impression with such care that nothing may enter that is not well examined. Never make any rambling enquiries after other people’s thoughts, but look directly at the mark which nature has set you.  Nature, I say, either that of the universe or your own; the first leads you to submission to Providence, the latter to act as becomes you.  Now that which is suitable to the frame and constitution of things is what becomes them.  To be more particular, the rest of the world is designed for the service of rational beings in consequence of this general appointment, by which the lower order of things are made for the use of the more noble.  And rational creatures are designed for the advantage of each other.  

## Social temper

Now a social temper is that which human nature was principally intended for; the next thing designed in our being is to be proof against corporeal impressions, it being the peculiar privilege of reason to move within herself, and not suffer sensation or passion to break in upon her; for these are both of animal and inferior quality.  But the understanding part claims a right to govern, and will not bend to matter or appetite; and good reason for it, since she was born to command and make use of them.  The third main requisite in a rational being is to secure the assent from rashness and mistake.  Let your mind but compass these points, and stick to them, and then she is mistress of everything which belongs to her.
